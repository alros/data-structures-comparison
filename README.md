# data-structures-comparison

a little experiment to show differences and performances of data structures

There is an example of measurement obtained with the code

```
 type            time to insert  time to find    fail
 ArrayStructure  43,993,376      9,033,290       False
 LinkedList      145,084,444     9,202,950       False
 BTree           796,571,810     669,562         False
 HashMap         233,445,188     258,856         False
```

time is expressed in CPU cycles
